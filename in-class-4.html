<!--i. create a const variable called firstObject and assign to it an object created via a literal constructor with a property called name and another property called echo. For the value of name put your first namd and for the value of echo add a function to console.log your name(remember to use the this keyword to access the name property of the object) and call the echo method of the firstName object 
ii. after the echo call from the previous question, update the value of the name to your last name and call echo again, you should have “in-class-4.js loaded!”, “your first name”, “Your last name” as output
